<p>I am <i>Md Arifuzzaman Faisal</i>. I have completed Bachelor of Science in ELectrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. I have a great passion on Nano Physics, Data Science, Machine Learning etc.</p>

<p>I have an insatiable desire for more knowledge and the exploration of previously discovered concepts, theories, approaches, etc. in the field of nanoelectronics and electromagnetics and love to think about new theories and evaluate these through computer analysis. Collaboration, teamwork, and volunteering are qualities that I love most.</p>

<p class="mb-5"> I want to be the best at everything I do, and I want to inspire myself and those I encounter along the way to grow together, cooperate, and produce exceptional results. I've always believed that anyone I've ever met would teach me something useful. I love meeting and getting to know new people, as well as collaborating with them to help them accomplish their goals. Life is a delectable meal that should be savored at any opportunity.</p>
