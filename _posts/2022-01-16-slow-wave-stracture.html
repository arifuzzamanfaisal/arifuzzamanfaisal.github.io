<p style="text-align: justify;">In microwave tubes, nonresonant periodic circuits or slow-wave structures are used to amplify the RF and microwave signal at higher power over a wider bandwidth.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Slow Wave Structures</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To amplify or generate radio frequency, electron beams need to interact with electromagnetic fields. But we know that the phase velocity of electromagnetic waves in the waveguide is higher than the speed of light. As a result, the electron beam has not gotten enough time to interact with electromagnetic waves. Hence we use a slow-wave structure to reduce the phase velocity of electromagnetic waves. </p>
