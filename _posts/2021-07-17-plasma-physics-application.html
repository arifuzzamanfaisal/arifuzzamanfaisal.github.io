<p>The fourth state of matter plasma is an ionized gas which is globally neutral and show collective behaviors. It is known that over 99 percent of the material in the universe remains in a plasma state. But its importance and character have been recognized in the 20th century. Plasma physics is an important branch of science to the scientist because with the help of plasma physics mechanisms nuclear fusion can be achieved in the earth to generate abundant, safe, carbon-free energy. Moreover, there are a number of other applications of plasma are found industrial and medicine fields. Plasma science and engineering are crucial to the nation's economic strength, are significant to national security, and affect daily life. Plasma physics is intellectually diverse field with a broad set of scientific challenges.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Plasma</h2>

<p>When the temperature of a solid is increased, the crystalline lattice structure will be destroyed and will be ended up with a liquid. If the temperature of the liquid is increased, the kinetic energy of the atoms will be increased and the distance between atoms also be increased and forms into gas. As the temperature of the gas increased, the kinetic energy of the atoms prompted the electrons to escape from the atom. It composes the matter of ions and electrons. This ionized gas is called plasma, the fourth state of matter. In conventional physics, the word "plasma" refers to a gas of charged particles of opposite electrical charges that is overall neutral and display collective effects. To understand the collective effect of plasma we need to define Debye length, Plasma frequency and Collision frequency. </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Application of Plasma</h2>

<p>Plasmas have global significance because of their growing effect. Companies of all sizes are benefited from the development fields ranging from one-person start-ups to the biggest manufacturing companies in the world. Plasma can be used to support humanity in a variety of ways. Semiconductor fabrication, nanotechnology, hydrogen extraction from alcohol, antenna beam shaping, plasma display panels, plasma polymerization, coating, plasma torch, cancer treatment, and so on are some of these applications. Furthermore, solid state plasmas, astrophysical plasmas, nuclear fusion are being extensively studied and applied. </p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Magnetic confinement Fusion </h3>

<p>Under intense heat and pressure, gaseous hydrogen fuel transforms into plasma Plasmas include the atmosphere in which light elements can combine and yield energy. The large magnetic coils mounted around the core will shape and regulate the charged particles of plasma [7]. Scientists are using this property to confine the hot plasma away from the container walls. Applying this science, International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is planned to achieve 500 MW of fusion power from the input of 50 MW heating power.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
