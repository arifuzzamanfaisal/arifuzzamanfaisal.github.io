<p>The fourth state of matter plasma is an ionized gas which is globally neutral and show collective behaviors. It is known that over 99 percent of the material in the universe remains in a plasma state. But its importance and character have been recognized in the 20th century. Plasma physics is an important branch of science to the scientist because with the help of plasma physics mechanisms nuclear fusion can be achieved in the earth to generate abundant, safe, carbon-free energy. Moreover, there are a number of other applications of plasma are found industrial and medicine fields. Plasma science and engineering are crucial to the nation's economic strength, are significant to national security, and affect daily life. Plasma physics is intellectually diverse field with a broad set of scientific challenges.</p>

<p>When the temperature of a solid is increased, the crystalline lattice structure will be destroyed and will be ended up with a liquid. If the temperature of the liquid is increased, the kinetic energy of the atoms will be increased and the distance between atoms also be increased and forms into gas. As the temperature of the gas increased, the kinetic energy of the atoms prompted the electrons to escape from the atom. It composes the matter of ions and electrons. This ionized gas is called plasma, the fourth state of matter. In conventional physics, the word "plasma" refers to a gas of charged particles of opposite electrical charges that is overall neutral and display collective effects. To understand the collective effect of plasma we need to define Debye length, Plasma frequency and Collision frequency. </p>
