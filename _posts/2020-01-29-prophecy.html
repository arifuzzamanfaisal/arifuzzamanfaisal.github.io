<p>The fourth state of matter plasma is an ionized gas which is globally neutral and show collective behaviors. It is known that over 99 percent of the material in the universe remains in a plasma state. But its importance and character have been recognized in the 20th century. Plasma physics is an important branch of science to the scientist because with the help of plasma physics mechanisms nuclear fusion can be achieved in the earth to generate abundant, safe, carbon-free energy. Moreover, there are a number of other applications of plasma are found industrial and medicine fields. Plasma science and engineering are crucial to the nation's economic strength, are significant to national security, and affect daily life. Plasma physics is intellectually diverse field with a broad set of scientific challenges.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Plasma</h2>

<p>When the temperature of a solid is increased, the crystalline lattice structure will be destroyed and will be ended up with a liquid. If the temperature of the liquid is increased, the kinetic energy of the atoms will be increased and the distance between atoms also be increased and forms into gas. As the temperature of the gas increased, the kinetic energy of the atoms prompted the electrons to escape from the atom. It composes the matter of ions and electrons. This ionized gas is called plasma, the fourth state of matter. In conventional physics, the word "plasma" refers to a gas of charged particles of opposite electrical charges that is overall neutral and display collective effects. To understand the collective effect of plasma we need to define Debye length, Plasma frequency and Collision frequency. </p>
<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
