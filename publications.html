<p>Under intense heat and pressure, gaseous hydrogen fuel transforms into plasma Plasmas include the atmosphere in which light elements can combine and yield energy. The large magnetic coils mounted around the core will shape and regulate the charged particles of plasma [7]. Scientists are using this property to confine the hot plasma away from the container walls. Applying this science, International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is planned to achieve 500 MW of fusion power from the input of 50 MW heating power.</p>

<p class="mb-5"> I want to be the best at everything I do, and I want to inspire myself and those I encounter along the way to grow together, cooperate, and produce exceptional results. I've always believed that anyone I've ever met would teach me something useful. I love meeting and getting to know new people, as well as collaborating with them to help them accomplish their goals. Life is a delectable meal that should be savored at any opportunity.</p>
